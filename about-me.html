                    <p>Hey there, I'm Taylor Hershberger. I speclialize in web development, UX/UI design, and SEO.</p>

                    <p>My college journey unfolded at the University of Colorado in Boulder, where I received a degree from the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Creative Technology and Design. During my time there, I focused on the world of interactivity – UX Design, Web Development, App Coding, Game Design, and even Programming Microcontrollers. It was a tech playground where I soaked up tons of knowledge and hands-on experience, all while playing on the CU Women’s Rugby Team for four action-packed years.</p>

                    <img class="alignleft" src="img/IMG-2529.JPG" width="340px">

                    <p>After I graduated, I found my first full time job at Brighter Vision Web Solutions, a start-up making waves by crafting websites for mental health professionals.  I started as a Technical Support Specialist where I mostly helped clients with SEO and making edits to their WordPress websites but the fast past and scrappy environment of a start up company allowed me quickly grow and find new opportunities for our company to improve. I made my way up to Technical Support Team Lead where I would handle complex issue and coordinate with third-party vendors and cross-functional teams.</p>

                    <p>I loved my time at Brighter Vision, when I started we had just under 3,000 live websites and 6 years later we more than doubled those numbers getting close to 6,500. We grew so much that we were acquired towards the end of 2020 so I was able to experience what it was like to go from a small start-up company to a large publicly owned company called Evercommerce. I recently parted ways with Brighter Vision to take time to pursue a new career path. As much as I enjoyed my time there, I felt like I was ready to sharpen my coding skills and take the next step towards becoming a web developer.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not immersed in tech, I'm hanging out with my Australian Cattle Dog mix, Luna. You'll catch me hitting the trails, nurturing my plants, grooving at festivals, going for jogs, making candles, and conquering the world of board and video games.</p>
